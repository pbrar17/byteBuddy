- Once you have the gemma3 model, run the follwing command `ollama serve`

## Ollama serve error fix
- If you get an error when running the serve command due to the socket/port already being used
-  End the process and re run the command
- On windows this can be done by running `netstat -aon | findstr :11434`
- Once the netstat is run, simply kill the task with this command `taskkill /PID <task> /F` (replace task with the id)
